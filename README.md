# Amine_Coffee_Shop ☕️
Welcome to Amine Coffee Shop. After landing in Paris in 2025, and as being addicted to coffee, I decided to launch my own project. My work is inspired by [M. Abdullah Tarek and M. Chibuzor Nwachukwu](https://github.com/abdullahtarek/coffee_shop_customer_service_chatbot/tree/main). **This project is still ongoing** and I will do further tests for potential improvements. My contribution involves prompt engineering techniques. I noticed a lack of generalization for responses. As a result, I upgraded the prompt to respond to different types of questions. This repository contains the dataset and python code to build a chatbot designed to enhance customer experiences in a coffee shop application. \
The chatbot is responsible to respond to user's questions that are only related to our coffee shop based on LLM techniques. This chatbot can assist with taking orders, answering detailed menu queries, and providing personalized product recommendations.
