# Amine_Coffee_Shop ☕️
After arriving in Paris in 2025, driven by my love for coffee, I decided to launch this personal project inspired by the works of [M. Abdullah Tarek and M. Chibuzor Nwachukwu](https://github.com/abdullahtarek/coffee_shop_customer_service_chatbot/tree/main). **This ongoing project** explores the intersection between AI agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). \
The chatbot is responsible for responding user's questions that are only related to our coffee shop based on LLM techniques. This chatbot can assist with taking orders, answering detailed menu queries, and providing personalized product recommendations.
# 🎯 Project Overview
The goal of the project is to:
* Block irrelevant or harmful questions using a Guard Agent for safe interactions.
* Answer questions about menu items and our coffee shop based on **RAG system**.
* Recommend personalized products based on market basket analysis recommendation engine.
* Take client's order for specific product(s).
